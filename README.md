# WorkflowyKeys

My test to do a chrome extension to enable some additional workflowy features.

Ideas include 
- shortcuts
  - To move a node to another node.
  - Goto node.
  - goto context or hashtag.
- show how many child node to a collapsed item on the right.
- Due/avaialble dates and color coding the counts above for items that are due this day (orange), overdue (red).
- Dates.
  - autocomplete tod, tomorrow, etc.
  - popup calendar.
- Hover legend showing how many due soon, etc by hashtag/context.

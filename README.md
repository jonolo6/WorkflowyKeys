# WorkflowyKeys

My test to do a chrome extension to enable some additional workflowy features.

Ideas include 
- shortcuts
  - to move a node to another node.
  - goto node
- show how many child node to a collapsed item on the right.
- Due/avaialble dates and color coding the counts above for items that are due this day (orange), overdue (red).
- dates
  - autocomplete tod, tomorrow, etc.
  - popup calendar.
